<p>
	This page explains how to request historical data for individual Index Option contracts.
	The <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/key-concepts'>history requests</a> on this page only return the prices and open interest of the Option contracts, not their implied volatility or Greeks.
	For information about history requests that return the daily implied volatility and Greeks, see <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/index-options/universes'>Universes</a>.
