  Index Options are a financial derivative that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the value of an underlying Index, such as the S&P 500 index, at the stated exercise price. No actual assets are bought or sold.
  This page explains the basics of Index Option data in the Research Environment.
  To get some data, see <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/index-options/universes'>Universes</a> or <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/index-options/individual-contracts'>Individual Contracts</a>.
