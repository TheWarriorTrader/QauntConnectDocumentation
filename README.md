## Objective of Structuring the Strategy

The objective is to structure the strategy as described in `strategia_spiegata.txt` and `knowledge_base.md`. This involves understanding the macroeconomic context, selecting sectors that align with that context, and choosing individual stocks based on fundamental analysis. Machine learning is used as a support tool to refine estimates and reduce the risk of overfitting. The entire approach is developed in Python and integrated with QuantConnect.
