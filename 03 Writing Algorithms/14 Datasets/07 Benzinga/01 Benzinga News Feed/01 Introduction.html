<p>The Benzinga News Feed dataset by Benzinga tracks US Equity news releases. The data covers about 1,250 articles per day across 8,000 Equities, starts in January 2016, and is delivered on a second frequency. This dataset is created by structuring the content produced by Benzinga's editorial team.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
