<p>Datasets all have different timezones. Most price datasets are timestamped in Eastern Time (ET). However, Future markets have more exotic timezones, depending on where the Future contract is trading. QuantConnect allows the raw data to be in different timezones. For US Equities, the timezone is ET. For Forex prices, the timezone is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In contrast, other charting platforms may display data with ET timestamps. Forex uses UTC, but CFD uses timezones relative to each of the CFD products that lists. QuantConnect accurately reflects all of these timezones from the relative markets that they're trading.
