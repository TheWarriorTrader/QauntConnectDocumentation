# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions on how to set up and use GitHub Copilot to develop the strategy described in the `knowledge_base.md` and `strategia_spiegata.txt` files.

## 1. Setting Up GitHub Copilot

To set up GitHub Copilot, follow these steps:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: If you haven't already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install GitHub Copilot Extension**: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. Search for "GitHub Copilot" and click "Install" to add the extension.
3. **Sign In to GitHub**: After installing the extension, you will be prompted to sign in to your GitHub account. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the sign-in process.

## 2. Using GitHub Copilot

Once you have set up GitHub Copilot, you can start using it to develop the strategy. Here are some tips on how to make the most of GitHub Copilot:

1. **Contextual Suggestions**: GitHub Copilot provides code suggestions based on the context of your code. As you type, it will suggest code completions, which you can accept by pressing `Tab`.
2. **Documentation Integration**: GitHub Copilot uses the entire documentation available in the repository as context. Make sure to keep the documentation files (`knowledge_base.md`, `strategia_spiegata.txt`, `examples.md`) up to date to improve the quality of suggestions.
3. **Code Snippets**: You can use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for various parts of the strategy. For example, if you need to implement a function to analyze macroeconomic data, start typing the function name and GitHub Copilot will suggest a complete implementation based on the context.

## 3. Best Practices

To get the best results from GitHub Copilot, follow these best practices:

1. **Write Clear Comments**: Adding clear and descriptive comments in your code will help GitHub Copilot understand the context and provide better suggestions.
2. **Use Descriptive Function Names**: Use descriptive and meaningful function names to give GitHub Copilot more context about the purpose of the function.
3. **Keep Documentation Updated**: Regularly update the documentation files in the `docs` directory to ensure that GitHub Copilot has the most relevant and accurate information to work with.

## 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using GitHub Copilot, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Restart VS Code**: Sometimes, simply restarting Visual Studio Code can resolve issues with the GitHub Copilot extension.
2. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection, as GitHub Copilot requires an internet connection to provide suggestions.
3. **Update Extension**: Make sure you are using the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension. Check for updates in the Extensions view in VS Code.

For more detailed troubleshooting and support, refer to the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot).

## 5. Additional Resources

Here are some additional resources to help you get started with GitHub Copilot:

- [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
- [Visual Studio Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- [QuantConnect Documentation](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs)

## 6. Using GitHub Codespaces

If you prefer to use GitHub Codespaces instead of Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Codespace**: Go to your repository on GitHub, click on the "Code" button, and then click on the "Open with Codespaces" tab. Click on "New codespace" to create a new Codespace.
2. **Set Up GitHub Copilot in Codespaces**: Once your Codespace is created, open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. Search for "GitHub Copilot" and click "Install" to add the extension.
3. **Sign In to GitHub**: After installing the extension, you will be prompted to sign in to your GitHub account. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the sign-in process.

## 7. Leveraging Full Repository Context

To ensure GitHub Copilot has full knowledge of all the files in the repository and the entire documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Organize Documentation**: Ensure all documentation files are stored in the `docs` directory. This includes `strategia_spiegata.txt`, `knowledge_base.md`, `examples.md`, and `copilot_instructions.md`.
2. **Update Documentation Regularly**: Keep the documentation files up to date with the latest information and examples. This will help GitHub Copilot provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.
3. **Use Descriptive Comments and Function Names**: Write clear and descriptive comments in your code, and use meaningful function names to give GitHub Copilot more context about the purpose of the code.
4. **Refer to Documentation in Code**: When writing code, refer to the relevant sections of the documentation to provide additional context for GitHub Copilot. For example, you can add comments with links to specific sections of the `knowledge_base.md` or `examples.md` files.

By following these steps, you can ensure that GitHub Copilot has full knowledge of the entire repository and documentation, making it more efficient in creating the strategy.

## 8. Conclusion

By following these instructions and best practices, you can effectively use GitHub Copilot to develop the strategy described in the `knowledge_base.md` and `strategia_spiegata.txt` files. Whether you are using Visual Studio Code or GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Copilot can help you write code more efficiently and accurately. Happy coding!
